# ðŸš€ Gemini CLI Project Handoff

## PROJECT CONTEXT
VividVoice is a creative writing tool that uses AI to analyze stories. Built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. Uses Google Genkit for AI flows and Firebase for backend. Has multiple AI analysis features (emotional tone, character chat, etc.).

Current branch: conflict-resolution-merge
Working directory: /workspaces/VividVoice

## CURRENT SITUATION
I've been resolving merge conflicts between feature branch and master. There's a detailed merge conflict resolution log at MERGE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_LOG.md that shows 9 conflicts that need to be resolved.

## IMMEDIATE TASKS

### 1. Delete AI Agent Task Files (Priority 1)
These are temporary instruction files that need to be removed:
```bash
rm AI_AGENT_TASK_1_SCHEMAS.md
rm AI_AGENT_TASK_2_COMPONENT.md  
rm AI_AGENT_TASK_3_AI_FLOW.md
rm AI_AGENT_TASK_4_ACTIONS.md
rm AI_AGENT_TASK_5_REGISTER_FLOW.md
rm AI_AGENT_TASK_6_ADD_TAB.md
rm AI_AGENT_TASK_7_VERIFICATION.md
```

### 2. Continue Merge Conflict Resolution
Follow the detailed plan in MERGE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_LOG.md

## PROJECT STRUCTURE
```
/workspaces/VividVoice/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ai/flows/          # AI analysis flows
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/               # Next.js app router
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/        # React components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib/              # Utilities and actions
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Dependencies (has conflicts)
â””â”€â”€ various .md files     # Documentation
```

## KEY FILES TO UNDERSTAND
- package.json (dependency conflicts)
- src/ai/dev.ts (import conflicts) 
- src/ai/flows/ (various flow conflicts)
- MERGE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_LOG.md (detailed conflict info)
- MAIN_BRANCH_CONFLICT_ANALYSIS.md (analysis of main branch state)
- CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_GUIDE.md (step-by-step resolution guide)
- AITALK.md (story context and project background)

## GETTING STARTED COMMANDS
```bash
# Check current location
pwd

# Show project structure
tree -I node_modules -L 3

# Read the conflict log and analysis files
cat MERGE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_LOG.md
cat MAIN_BRANCH_CONFLICT_ANALYSIS.md
cat CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_GUIDE.md
cat AITALK.md

# Check git status
git status

# See what files have conflicts
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# Delete the AI agent task files
rm AI_AGENT_TASK_*.md
```

## CLI TIPS vs CODESPACES

### Context Management
- Codespaces: Automatic workspace context
- CLI: Need to explicitly provide file paths and context
- Tip: Use find and ls commands to show structure first

### File Operations  
- Codespaces: Direct file editing tools
- CLI: Use cat, head, tail to read files, then manual editing
- Tip: Always use absolute paths and verify contents before/after

### Terminal Commands
- Codespaces: Integrated terminal with persistent sessions  
- CLI: Each command is independent
- Tip: Chain commands with && and use cd in each command

### Best Practices
```bash
# Always check current directory
pwd

# Show project structure first
tree -I node_modules

# Read key files to understand project
cat package.json
cat README.md

# Use grep to find specific patterns
grep -r "specific-term" src/
```

## NEXT STEPS
1. Delete AI agent task files
2. Review AITALK.md for project story and context
3. Review MERGE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_LOG.md 
4. Review MAIN_BRANCH_CONFLICT_ANALYSIS.md for context
5. Review CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_GUIDE.md for step-by-step process
6. Start resolving the 9 documented merge conflicts
7. Follow the validation checklist in the log
8. Test the application after each resolution

The merge conflict log has detailed strategies for each conflict - follow those step by step along with the conflict resolution guide.
