**Author:** AI Coding Partner, Firebase Studio
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Finalized for Initial Launch

---

## 1. Introduction & Vision

**Staging Stories with the Skeptical Wombat** is a sophisticated, AI-powered web application designed to transform static written narratives into dynamic, immersive audio-visual experiences. It serves as a creative co-pilot for writers, providing not only expressive text-to-speech generation but also a comprehensive suite of advanced literary analysis tools. The core vision is to bridge the gap between the written word and a fully realized performance, empowering creators to hear their stories come to life and to analyze their craft with unprecedented depth.

## 2. Target Audience

The primary target audience includes:

*   **Creative Writers & Novelists:** Authors who want to hear their characters' dialogue performed, check the pacing of their scenes, and get a new perspective on their work-in-progress.
*   **Screenwriters & Playwrights:** Writers who need to quickly prototype scenes, hear the flow of dialogue, and analyze character dynamics.
*   **Hobbyist Storytellers & Fan-Fiction Authors:** Enthusiasts looking for a powerful tool to enhance their creative process and share their stories in a more engaging format.
*   **Writing Students & Educators:** Individuals studying the craft of writing who can use the analysis tools to deconstruct narratives and learn about literary techniques.

## 3. User Problems & Solutions

**Staging Stories** addresses several key problems faced by writers:

| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Inner voice" monologue is limiting:** Writers can't easily hear how their dialogue sounds when spoken by different characters. | **Multi-Voice Audio Generation:** The application generates a single, cohesive "radio play" with unique, AI-assigned voices for each character, complete with emotional delivery. |
| **Lack of objective feedback on craft:** It's difficult for a writer to objectively analyze their own work for pacing, character balance, or use of literary devices. | **The Director's Room:** A suite of one-click AI analysis tools provides data-driven, objective feedback on everything from dialogue dynamics to narrative pacing and trope usage. |
| **Difficulty in character development:** Ensuring a character's voice is consistent and unique can be challenging. | **AI Actor's Studio:** An interactive chat interface allows writers to "interview" their characters, helping to flesh out their personality and speaking style. |
| **Creative blocks and stale ideas:** Writers often struggle with unoriginal plots or predictable character arcs. | **Trope Inverter & Perspective Shifter:** AI tools designed to spark creativity by offering concrete suggestions on how to subvert common tropes or re-frame the story from a different point of view. |
| **Ensuring narrative consistency:** It's easy to lose track of small details (e.g., eye color, plot points) in a long narrative. | **Consistency Guardian:** An AI-powered editor that scans the entire text for continuity errors and inconsistencies. |

## 4. Feature Specification

### 4.1. Core Experience

These features form the main user workflow from story submission to audio playback.

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description | User Story |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CE-01** | **Story Input Form** | A simple textarea where users can paste their story text. Includes a pre-filled example to guide formatting. | "As a user, I want to easily paste my story into the application to begin the generation process." |
| **CE-02** | **AI Story Parsing** | The system intelligently parses the raw text, distinguishing between narration and character dialogue based on formatting cues (e.g., "Character: Dialogue"). | "As a user, I want the app to automatically understand which parts are narration and which are dialogue, without me needing to manually tag them." |
| **CE-03** | **AI Casting Director** | The AI analyzes each character's description and actions within the story to assign them a unique, fitting voice from a library of options. | "As a user, I want the AI to choose voices for my characters that match their personalities, so I don't have to." |
| **CE-04** | **Character Portrait Generation** | Upon parsing, the system generates a photorealistic, cinematic-style portrait for each character (excluding the Narrator). | "As a user, I want to see a visual representation of my characters to help bring them to life." |
| **CE-05** | **Dialogue Editor** | An interactive UI where users can review the parsed segments, edit the text, and fine-tune the `emotion` for each line to guide the TTS performance. | "As a user, I want to be able to correct any parsing errors and set the emotional tone for each line before generating the audio." |
| **CE-06** | **Multi-Voice Audio Generation** | The system generates a single, cohesive audio file for the entire scene using SSML, with different voices for each character. | "As a user, I want a single audio file that sounds like a radio play, with seamless transitions between characters." |
| **CE-07** | **Synchronized Highlighting** | During playback, the system highlights the exact words being spoken in the story text in real-time, karaoke-style, based on a detailed transcript. | "As a user, I want to follow along with the text as the audio plays, so I can see exactly which words are being spoken." |
| **CE-08** | **AI-Powered Sound Design** | The AI scans the narrative for sound cues (e.g., "a door creaked open") and automatically layers in sound effects to enhance immersion. | "As a user, I want the app to automatically add sound effects to my story to make it more immersive." |
| **CE-09** | **Audio Playback Controls** | The story display includes controls for play/pause, seek forward/backward, playback speed, and volume. | "As a user, I want standard playback controls to manage my listening experience." |

### 4.2. The Director's Room: Advanced Analysis Suite

This is a tabbed interface within the editor providing a suite of AI-powered analysis tools.

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description |

| **DA-06** | **Unreliable Narrator Mode** | An experimental tool that can rewrite the narrator's parts to reflect a specific bias (e.g., "Secretly the Villain"), offering a new creative lens. |
| **DA-07** | **"Show, Don't Tell" Converter** | Finds "telling" sentences (e.g., "She was angry") and suggests more descriptive "showing" alternatives. |
| **DA-08** | **Consistency Guardian** | Scans the story for continuity errors, such as a character's eye color changing or plot inconsistencies. |
| **DA-09** | **Subtext Analyzer** | Uncovers the unspoken meaning behind lines of dialogue, explaining the hidden emotions and motivations. |
